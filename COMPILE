You can compile wxHexEditor with Code::Blocks (C::B) easily.
All you need to install C::B for your OS, required compilation toolset (gcc) and wxHexEditor library for compilation.

But you can also build wxHexEditor from your shell.
For compiling wxHexEditor, without C::B you have to build internal udis and mhash libraries. They are automatically compiled when you run make command.

Please follow those directives under your OS to compile wxHexEditor.
-----------------------------------------------------
LINUX
-----------------------------------------------------
For Linux, make sure you have installed wxWidgets.
Use this command for ubuntu like distros:

   apt-get install libwxgtk<version>-dev

or use your need to use this one for distros like OpenSuSE...

  zypper in wxWidgets-devel

Then extract the wxHexEditor:

  tar xvf wxHexEditor-v<version>-src.tar.bz2
  cd wxHexEditor
  make

you can also use OPTFLAGS and WXCONFIG flags if you have different wx-config name like
  make WXCONFIG=wx-config CPPFLAGS="-fPIC" OPTFLAGS="-O3 -march-native -fopenmp"

Than you could use this command for installing wxHexEditor to your computer.
  make install

-----------------------------------------------------
WINDOWS
-----------------------------------------------------
For generating Windows executables, I use Linux to cross-compile a Windows executable via MinGW.
If you have cygwin, than good luck to build this with make command. But you are better to use C::B.

On Linux Cross-Compiling To WINDOWS
-----------------------------------------------------
If you have Linux installation and want to build Win32/Win64 build of wxHexEditor, follow this guide.
This is how I compile.
First, I compile the wxWidgets library with a cross compiler:

tar xvf wxWidgets-<version>.tar.bz2
cd wxWidgets
mkdir release
cd release
../configure --enable-{monolithic,static,unicode} --disable-{debug,shared} --host=i686-w64-mingw32
make

Then I extract the wxHexEditor:

tar xvf wxHexEditor-v<version>-src.tar.bz2
cd wxHexEditor
make win WXCONFIG=<wx-congif path> HOST=i686-w64-mingw32

PS: If you face with " _rpl_malloc " error, you can use 

ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes make win WXCONFIG=<wx-congif path> HOST=i686-w64-mingw32

PS2: for 64Bit build, you need to run with HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32 instead of HOST=i686-w64-mingw32.

-----------------------------------------------------
OS X
-----------------------------------------------------
You need to have Xcode Commandline Tools installed on your Mac.

You can easily install required dependencies with Homebrew installation:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

After you could install required dependencies with this command:
brew install wxmac gettext autoconf automake

Instead of wxmac library, you might need to compile wxWidgets from source.
Download wxWidgets source to your disk and with:
tar xvf wxWidgets-<version>.tar.bz2
cd wxWidgets
mkdir release
cd release
../configure --with-osx_cocoa --with-macosx-version-min=10.7  --disable-shared  --disable-mediactrl --with-{zlib,expat,libpng,libtiff,jpeg}=builtin --with-opengl --enable-universal-binary=x86_64,i386 CXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11" OBJCXXFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11" LDFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++" --enable-{release,unicode,monolithic}

PS:You might have some compilation issues with wxWidgets 3.1 using OSX 10.13.

After you make ready the dependencies,
then extract the wxHexEditor and compile with:
tar xvf wxHexEditor-v<version>-src.tar.bz2
cd wxHexEditor
make mac WXCONFIG=<wx-config path>

Opps! I forgot to say that, you probably need to remove -lgomp and -fopenmp included lines at Makefile manually due clang doesn't support OpenMP yet.

If everything is OK, your executable is available to execute under:
./wxHexEditor.app/Contents/MacOS/wxHexEditor

That's all.

-----------------------------------------------------
BSD
-----------------------------------------------------
First of all, you need to install all dependencies.
In FreeBSD, you can use pkg command

pkg install automake autoconf wx30-gtk2 gmake

Then extract the wxHexEditor and compile with:
tar xvf wxHexEditor-v<version>-src.tar.bz2
cd wxHexEditor
gmake WXCONFIG=<wx-config path>

for example : gmake WXCONFIG=wxgtk2u-3.0-config

If you are lucky, this will compile the (dependencies mhash and udis86 than) program without any error.
