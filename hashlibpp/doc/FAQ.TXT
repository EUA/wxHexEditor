Q1) 	What is hashlib++ ?
A1)	hashlib++ is a simple and very easy to use library to create a 
	cryptographic checksum (like MD5 or SHA1) called "hash" in C++. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

Q2)	What functions are supported?	
A2)	By now hashlib++ supports the following functions:
	* MD5		Message-Digest algorithm 5
	* SHA1  	Secure Hash Algorithm 1
	* SHA2-Family 	Secure Hash Algorithm 256, 384 and 512

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

Q3)	I'm getting a linker error like this: 
	"undefined reference to md5wrapper::md5wrapper()". What can I do?
A3)	If you are using hashlib++ as source code library you probably forgot 
	to add the *.cpp files to your project.
	If you are using hashlib++ as static library you need to link against
	this library (Please refer to your compiler's manual).
